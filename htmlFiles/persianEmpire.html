        <h3 class="content-header">The Elamites (3200 BCE - 539 BCE)</h3>
            <p>Elam (also called Susiana after their capital Susa) was the first urban civilization of the Iranian plateau. The first connection between the Elamites and a concrete historical individual is attested in the Sumerian King's List. The text documents that the land of Elam was conquered by King Enmebaragesi of Kish in the early 3rd millenium BCE.

            <p>The earliest documented Elamite dynasty, referred to as the Awan Dynasty (2700 - 1600 BCE), ruled over Elam from an administrative city-state whose wherabouts reamain undiscovered. This dynasty extended their terrirory into Sumer after subduing the Ur Dynasty. After maintaining hegemony for a brief period of time over the Sumerian city-states, the Awan Dynasty became the target of Assyrian expansion in the late 3rd millenium BCE. The great emporer of Assyria, Sargon of Akkad boasted of his sack of Awan. Sargon of Akkad's successor and son - Riumush, chronicled himself of dominating Elam and defeating the Elamite King Emahsini. Following these military defeats at the end of the 3rd millenium BCE, Elam was reduced to a tributary state under the domination of the newly established Assyrian Empire.</p>
                <aside>The earliest document of the Elamite language is a treaty signed between Naram-Sin of Akkad and an unkown defeated king of of Awan.</aside>
